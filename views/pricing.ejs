          Breaking into the web design market is hard. Because I just started
          focusing on building my business, I don't have any reviews...yet. If
          you happen to be my first client, I'll design your site for free. All
          I ask is that you leave me an honest, thorough video review when we're
          finished.

          I set up how your site looks, create relevant links, and insert any
          content and/or pictures you may want to use. The site conveys
          information, but does not have any other functionality.

          Not only do you want me to design how your site looks, but you also
          want me to build other features such as user profiles login
          capability, password reset, etc.

          That's definitely an option, but I can't quote an accurate price until
          you tell me what exactly you want the site to do. Let's go over your
          project and I'll give you my one-time fee.
